## US Visa Approval Prediction
This project analyzes historical U.S. visa application data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a visa application will be approved or denied. The dataset from Kaggle contains detailed application information such as job titles, wages, application years, and statuses.

Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, I created a classification pipeline capable of handling imbalanced data and providing explainable predictions. The final model was deployed as an interactive web application where users can input applicant details to estimate their approval chances.

This project demonstrates skills in **EDA**, **feature engineering**, **model building, model evaluation, and deployment**, aligning with real-world ML pipelines in the MLOps lifecycle.

## **1) About**

The USA visa application process is complex and highly competitive. The **Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)** processes thousands of visa applications each year from employers seeking to hire foreign workers. With the rise in applications, efficiently evaluating and predicting visa outcomes has become a critical need.

This project aims to analyze historical visa application data to understand the key factors that influence approval decisions and build a predictive system that can assist in the decision-making process.

## **2) Problem Statement**

The **OFLC** receives and processes job certification applications for foreign workers applying for U.S. visas. With the surge in applications in recent years, manually reviewing each application has become increasingly time-consuming and resource-intensive.

This project will leverage **machine learning classification models** to:

- Predict whether a visa application will be **approved or denied** based on historical data.  
- Identify key patterns and criteria influencing the approval decision.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to streamline the visa evaluation and shortlisting process.

By implementing this solution, the OFLC can improve efficiency, enhance decision accuracy, and speed up the processing of applications.

## **3) Project Goals**

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns in the dataset.  
- Build and compare multiple **machine learning models** to identify the best-performing approach.  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Provide actionable insights from data analysis and modeling to support decision-making.

## **4) Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, etc.  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for project tracking and collaboration.

## **5) Expected Outcome**

A **machine learning-based predictive model** that can accurately determine the likelihood of visa approval, along with key insights into the factors influencing these decisions.
